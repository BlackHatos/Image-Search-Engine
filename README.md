<p style="font-size:10%">I would like to thank <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/947271/lucas">Lucas</a> for helping me with the image search.</p>

# Updates
<p>3.0 --- added a page that let's you search by a specified height and width (thank you <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1171702/wazz">Wazz</a> for helping me add this feature)</p>

# Why I made this
I originally wanted to make this so I (and others) could easily look for 4K, 8K, 10K, and 16K images. It ended up having a bigger use though, as far as I'm aware this is the only way to search google for images with a specific height/width.

# Things I plan on doing with this in the future
I'm not sure yet

# Things I need help with
Nothing at the moment
