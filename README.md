#Why I made this
I originally wanted to make this so I (and others) could easily look for 4K, 8K, 10K, and 16K images. It ended up having a bigger use though, as far as I'm aware this is the only way to search google for images with a specific height/width.

Things I plan on doing with this in the future
I would like to make a page where you can specify a height/width and then make a search with it... you know instead of using preset sizes...
