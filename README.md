# Why I made this
<p>I originally wanted to make this so I (and others) could easily look for 4K, 8K, 10K, and 16K images. It ended up having a bigger use though, as far as I'm aware this is the only way to search google for images with a specific height/width.</p>

# Things I plan on doing with this in the future
<p>I'm not sure yet</p>
